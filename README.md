This is kinda my own linux Distro but not really but it is based with my config for Kde desktop

To use it, you'll need to have Debian 11 or later installed and choose the KDE desktop environment since the script relies on it. An internet connection is also necessary. or use Kubuntu 

You can see how it looks in this screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/r4m1BNU.png

I tested this on Debian unstable, and I've also made it available for other distributions like Kubuntu. The Papirus Icon Theme (https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) is also included.

For package management, I used Nala, a frontend for apt (https://gitlab.com/volian/nala).

Warning only use debian version on only debian and the Kubuntu/Ubuntu variants with kde desktop


Not tested witk Kde neon yet
